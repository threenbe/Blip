# Blip
An assembler-like program for a fictional language called Blip, which used Polish (prefix) notation for its arithmetic.

"Blip" supported the following instructions:

- **text**: Essentially print statement, must be followed a string in quotes
- **output**: Evaluates and outputs the result of the arithmetic following this statement
- **var**: Declares and sets a variable
- **set**: Sets a variable to either a constant or the result of some arithmetic

There are some examples of Blip code uploaded to this repo.

See [Blip2](https://github.com/threenbe/Blip-2) for an extended and improved version of this project.
