# Blip
An assembler-like program for a fictional language called Blip, which used Polish (prefix) notation for its arithmetic.

I'm slightly unsure whether this is the correct version of this project. When I built the extended version of this project (with ifs, elses, and loops) I made a mess of all the files. It's probably correct though.
